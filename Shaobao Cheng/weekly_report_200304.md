# Done
- finished yolo-lite convolution layer 1 test and results of RTL simulation and cmodel simulation are the same 

# To Do
- because of the vivado simulator will abort when the simulation time is too long while the simulation hasnt finish, so i decide to divide the whole input feature into many part which is small enough to finish the simulation before it abort
- finish the rest of layers and make a comparation between RTL simulation and cmodel simulation
