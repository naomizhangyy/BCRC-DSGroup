Writing master academic dissertation,including 
  the review of open source ISA and RISC-V and the review of deep learning accelerator.
But I have no idea how I can write the paper for meeting the request of 30 thousands words.

2019/03/28
Continue writing master academic thesis,completing the main parts of it. 

2019/04/04
1.spent about two days to learn latex for writing easily.
2.spent about one day to daw some basic visio template of digital circuits。
3.spent about two days to learn axi protocol，but some topics like atomic access was not made sence by me。

2019/04/12～2019/04/18
  2019.04.12:
    Write the directional verification plan of the icb2axi protocol convertor including simple test point decomposition.
    
2019/04/19～2019/04/25:
    1.Finish the soc side icb2axi protocol convertor verification.
    2.Finish icb2dla bus design and verification
    3.Clip dla codes. Finish the soc side. And still doing in ddr side. It's a little bit complex.

    next week plan：
    1.Make the plan in detail of what I really need to do？（soc with coprocessor or soc with bus connecting IP. discuss with Haozhe Zhu).
      The plan should include the functional requirements and performance indicators of soc, the rationale and performance evaluation of 
      each ip, the design of the overall architecture, advantages, disadvantages and possible risks. Assess the feasibility of the plan 
      and whether the risks can be solved. First, do a good job of top-level design, then start the actual work.
    2.Research on collaboration with planning, performance analysis of IP.
    3.Learn computer organization and design。
    
 2019/04/26~2019/05/09:

      1.Finish learning the basic knowledge of computer organization and design.
      2.Investigate and survey about the advantages and disadvantages of soc with coprocessor or soc with bus connecting IP.
        Then I make sure the solution of coprocessor is better than the solution of bus IP, and the advantages mainly include
        reduction memory access frequency therefor performance better and power consumption lower. But some challenges come 
        including cache coherence and complier with coprocessor instructions.
